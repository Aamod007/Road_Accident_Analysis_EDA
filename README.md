# Road Accident Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## üìå Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a **road accident dataset** to extract meaningful insights that could aid in improving road safety and policy-making. The analysis is performed using Python and visualized through libraries like **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

---

## üìä Key Insights
1. **Accident Severity Distribution:** Accident severity is almost equally distributed among Minor, Moderate, and Severe cases (~33% each).
2. **Medical Costs Analysis:** Medical costs remained consistent across severity levels, averaging ‚Çπ25,000.
3. **Weather Conditions Impact:** Rainy weather posed the highest risk for fatal accidents.
4. **Road Conditions and Injuries:** Icy roads had the highest average number of injuries (~9.5).
5. **Speed Limits & Vehicles Involved:** The number of vehicles involved in accidents (~2.5) remained consistent across speed limits.

## üöÄ How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Road_Accident_Analysis_EDA.git

2. Navigate to the downloaded repository folder:
   ```bash
   cd Road_Accident_Analysis_EDA

3. Open **Google Colab**

4. Click **File** > **Upload Notebook**

5. Upload the file **Global Road Accidents Dataset** from **Kaggle**.
   

7. Install **pandas**
   ```bash
   pip insatll panadas

8. Install **matplotlib**
    ```bash
   pip install matplotlib

9. Install **seaborn**
   ```bash
   pip install seaborn

10. Run the **Notebook**
Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially:
- The code cells are designed for tasks like data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- Outputs like graphs and insights will appear below their respective code cells.

---

## üîÆ Future Scope
- Incorporating machine learning models to predict accident severity.
- Expanding the analysis with real-time accident data.
- Integrating road safety recommendations into actionable strategies.
