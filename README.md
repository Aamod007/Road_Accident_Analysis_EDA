# Road Accident Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a **road accident dataset** to extract meaningful insights that could aid in improving road safety and policy-making. The analysis is performed using Python and visualized through libraries like **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

## 📊 Key Insights
1. **Accident Severity Distribution:** Accident severity is almost equally distributed among Minor, Moderate, and Severe cases (~33% each).
2. **Medical Costs Analysis:** Medical costs remained consistent across severity levels, averaging ₹25,000.
3. **Weather Conditions Impact:** Rainy weather posed the highest risk for fatal accidents.
4. **Road Conditions and Injuries:** Icy roads had the highest average number of injuries (~9.5).
5. **Speed Limits & Vehicles Involved:** The number of vehicles involved in accidents (~2.5) remained consistent across speed limits.
